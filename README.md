Project for the Model Driven Decision Making course at the University of Pisa, focusing on the nesting of convex 2D polygons. The project draws inspiration from the study "The Dotted-Board Model" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.04.009) and aims to develop algorithms based on its findings.

The implementation includes a modified version of the Minkowski Sum code, sourced from https://github.com/fefei69/Math_for_robotics_HW5/blob/10d53611ca636a7e8d5b391c96d9ad73cfa4bf04/minkowski.py#L13, with gratitude to [@fefei69] (https://www.github.com/fefei69) for the contribution.
